#The idea behind showing the data in these three formats was that the user could decide what factors mattered most to them when deciding what game they might purchase given the criteria they have chosen. Showing all three may help them make decisions when factors are close and visuals may be more beneficial than a table for this (particularly in years with lots of games).
